# Algorithms & data structures project

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.



## Time complexity And Space Complexity
<b>Time Complexity</b>: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.



<b>Space Complexity</b>: The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Consider an example: Suppose a problem to find the frequency of array elements.
